# Rocket Takeoff and Landing Simulation with Trust Vector Control

## Overview

This MATLAB simulation project focuses on the 3 Degree of Freedom (3DOF) control system for rocket takeoff and landing. The simulation utilizes Thrust Vector Control (TVC) to control the pitch angle and flight path angle of the rocket.

## Features

- **3DOF Simulation:** Simulate the rocket's dynamics in three dimensions, considering pitch, yaw, and roll.
- **Trust Vector Control:** Implement a control system that adjusts the rocket's trust vector for optimal pitch and flight path angle control.
- **Takeoff and Landing Scenarios:** Simulate both takeoff and landing phases, providing insights into the entire rocket trajectory.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R201X or later
- [Additional MATLAB Toolboxes, if any]

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamnarendrans/RocketTakeOFF-Landing.git
    ```

2. **Run the Simulation:**
    - Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
    - Open the main simulation script: `parameters.m`.
    - Run the script to initiate the simulation.

3. **Explore Results:**
    - The simulation results, including graphs and relevant data, will be displayed in the MATLAB environment.
    - Customize parameters and initial conditions as needed.

## Results

Include visualizations or descriptions of the simulation results. Screenshots, graphs, or animations can be added here.
